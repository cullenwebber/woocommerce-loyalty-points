== Description ==

A simple plugin to demonstrate utilizing object orientation to create a point system for woocommerce.
You can set how many points are earnt per dollar spent, point redeeming threshold, dollar discount per point redeeming threshold and maximum point accrual.

This plugin was created in about 4 hours, so keep that in mind.
Works fine for what it needs to do.
